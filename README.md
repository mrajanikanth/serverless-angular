## Setup

To skip all this you could also just click this button:

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/mrajanikanth/serverless-angular&utm_source=github&utm_medium=ng-prerender-tzm&utm_campaign=devex)

### Local Setup

### Productions Setup

- install the Netlify CLI `npm i netlify-cli -g`
- run `netlify init` to setup the project on Netlify & deploy it! (the [/netlify.toml](/netlify.toml) file has the information Netlify needs to deploy your app)
- run `netlify open` to open the project dashboard, under the 'Functions' tab you can find the endpoint for your function as well as see all the logs.

## The pieces

- this project has a skeleton for an eCommerce application that can be used as an app shell that can pre-rendered and then hydrated with [Netlify Function](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/?utm_source=repo&utm_medium=au-prerender-tzm&utm_campaign=devex).
- Scully info
- the only other additional file is the [Netlify configuration file](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/?utm_source=repo&utm_medium=au-prerender-tzm&utm_campaign=devex) which tells Netlify how and what to deploy to the CDN :)
